# Example Section File (ALL CAPS)

Here’s what an individual file might look like:

### **ALL CAPS**

Writing in **ALL CAPITAL LETTERS** is commonly interpreted as shouting or expressing strong emotion.
This convention started in early internet forums and email, where there were no bold or italic fonts.
Today, ALL CAPS may indicate:

* shouting
* urgency
* excitement
* humor or dramatization

Using it sparingly is considered more polite and easier to read.
